abstract: >-
  Metaskill is a single Claude Code skill that autonomously researches any
  domain via web search, then generates a complete, ready-to-use AI agent
  team configuration (.claude/ directory with orchestrator, specialist agents,
  skills, rules, and MCP servers). It is a "skill that creates skills" —
  one prompt to bootstrap an entire autonomous development team.
